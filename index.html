      Tibits is a vegetarian restaurant I discovered when I moved to
      Switzerland. Unlike a traditional restaurant where you come and order
      food, it works with a buffet concept, so you come, choose your food and
      can either have it inside or order to take away. Unlike some buffets I
      have been to before, in Tibits food always tastes fresh and delicious.
      Tibits claims "We value cooking with fresh, natural products. tibits
      treats are glutamate-free, without artificial additives and free of
      genetically modified foods. All baked goods, dairy products and free-range
      eggs are of organic or Demeter quality." I can attest. On top of that,
      food is amazingly healthy, and time-demanding to cook. Last but no least,
      the decoration full of plants and cozy is very inviting. I always love my
      visits to Tibits.
